00:00:02.348 --> 00:00:05.704
The service-oriented approach
to linking software systems and

3
00:00:05.704 --> 00:00:10.440
applications is transforming the way
many organizations share data.

4
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.730
This approach improves existing
methods of data sharing,

5
00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.029
by providing a service
layer between systems.

6
00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:21.100
Sharing data between applications
is a well-established principle

7
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.630
that works on a simple level.

8
00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.980
As systems expand, the solution that
connects two software applications

9
00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.850
will often not work for a third.

10
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.170
What began as a workable system,
then locks valuable data in a silo.

11
00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.460
Sharing the data is still possible,
but requires adaptations and tweaks.

12
00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.270
The process is laborious and

13
00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.400
time consuming,
leading to bottlenecks and overload.

14
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:55.214
The reality of this world is unnecessary
effort expended in duplication of data.

15
00:00:55.214 --> 00:00:57.431
[MUSIC]

16
00:00:57.431 --> 00:01:01.243
By applying a service layer to
the applications you wish to connect up,

17
00:01:01.243 --> 00:01:04.500
data is offered up in a common format for
reuse elsewhere.

18
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.520
The service-oriented approach works
with existing software systems and

19
00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.130
does not require you to remove
the monolithic application.

20
00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.620
Replacement applications reuse
the links already made and

21
00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.270
can plug into the service layer
without affecting other users of the data.

22
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.200
New applications can be added to
grow overall system architectures in

23
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.910
the same way.

24
00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.520
The data in each application,

25
00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.360
is offered up as a service which
any other application can consume.

26
00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.412
When the service-oriented approach is
evolved into a system-wide architecture,

27
00:01:38.412 --> 00:01:39.966
it allows connections and

28
00:01:39.966 --> 00:01:44.922
service sharing opportunities between
organizations nationally and globally.

29
00:01:44.922 --> 00:01:49.381
[MUSIC]

30
00:01:49.381 --> 00:01:52.830
Take monitoring of student progress for
example.

31
00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.660
Results are logged by a virtual learning
environment, but how much of that data is

32
00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.529
shared with a management system that is
tracking progression against funding?

33
00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.000
If the motivation and commitment of
struggling students is not addressed and

34
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.820
they decide to walk away,
there is a direct impact on funding.

35
00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.518
If the data is freed up and

36
00:02:13.518 --> 00:02:16.991
shared across a system using
a service-oriented approach,

37
00:02:16.991 --> 00:02:22.210
it could contribute to retaining student
motivation, and thereby maximizing income.

38
00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:27.193
[MUSIC]

39
00:02:27.193 --> 00:02:31.133
And what if across the education
community, there was one standard and

40
00:02:31.133 --> 00:02:33.580
agreed way to describe a course?

41
00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.530
It would allow course information to be
made available as a consumable service,

42
00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.550
both internally and externally.

43
00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.560
This is the subject of a current project
called Exchanging Course Related

44
00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.700
Information or XCRI,
encompassing course marketing,

45
00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.140
quality assurance, enrollment, and
reporting requirements.

46
00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.940
This service-oriented approach
enables aggregated organizations,

47
00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.460
like UCAS, to gather the standard and

48
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:03.050
agreed descriptions of
courses from each provider.

49
00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.806
Comprehensive details of approved
enrollment opportunities,

50
00:03:07.806 --> 00:03:12.251
are then returned to a prospective
student for easy and accurate comparison.

51
00:03:12.251 --> 00:03:14.848
[MUSIC]

52
00:03:14.848 --> 00:03:18.340
Amongst the research community,
it is the same principle.

53
00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.600
Here, the service-oriented approach
is enabling researchers to

54
00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.990
work across institutions
in virtual organizations.

55
00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:30.650
MyGrid is a project that provides a shared
toolkit for creating experiments by

56
00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:36.440
coordinating the information flow between
distributed resources and services.

57
00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.450
Workflows and query specifications
link together remote and

58
00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.180
local resources using
web service protocols.

59
00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.590
Workflows created by myGrid
represent the scientific

60
00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.060
process of the experiments they enact,
making them a rich resource for

61
00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.060
scientists creating their
own new experiments.

62
00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.372
The service layer to this data
enables users to share, re-use, and

63
00:04:00.372 --> 00:04:04.082
re-purpose experiments
within the myGrid community.

64
00:04:04.082 --> 00:04:13.611
[MUSIC]

65
00:04:13.611 --> 00:04:17.926
Many education and research services
are already developing a service-oriented

66
00:04:17.926 --> 00:04:20.845
approach taking their lead
from the business world and

67
00:04:20.845 --> 00:04:22.440
major software developers.

68
00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.830
It is in this context that
the e-Framework, a successful and

69
00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:32.060
expanding international initiative,
works to make sense of the

70
00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:35.460
service-oriented approach for
the education and research community.

71
00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:42.190
The e-Framework website identifies and
describes the service components needed.

72
00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.900
It provides the blueprints and
reference example for

73
00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.350
those in the community who want to
gain a greater understanding and

74
00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:51.780
knowledge of how to implement
a service-oriented approach.

75
00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:57.650
The e-Framework website is thus becoming
a knowledge base that is developing

76
00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:02.243
a shared vocabulary and way of thinking
for all in education and research.
